# Behavior Interface

Interface between a data acquisition device on one end as well as, both,
1) input from capacitive lick sensors, and
2) reward output to valves on the other end.

Digital events (licks, rewards) are displayed by means of LEDs.
Circuit breakers can be used to reset the capacitive sensors.
